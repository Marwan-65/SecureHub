# SecureHub
#### A fake application made for the cyber security course. It encrypts the device's files once the SecureHub.exe is ran and hides the key using steganography in a file among many other dummy files. It then prompts the target to pay, and once he pays the program calls helper.exe to retrieve the key and decrypt the files.
